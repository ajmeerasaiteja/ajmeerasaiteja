## 🔍(Mechanical Engineering Fun Facts)

🔩 **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** allows engineers to simulate stress, vibration, and heat—cutting down on physical prototypes and reducing design costs.

🌬️ **HVAC psychrometrics** plays a key role in comfort systems: controlling humidity is just as important as temperature!

⚙️ **3D Printing (Additive Manufacturing)** is revolutionizing aerospace and defense — offering lightweight, customizable parts in record time.

💡 **Six Sigma** in manufacturing isn't just about quality—DMAIC frameworks save millions by reducing downtime and rework.

🧰 **CMMS (like SAP)** and predictive maintenance can increase equipment availability by over 20%.
